# DSA in Java  

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java. This repo serves as a collection of my practice problems, implementations, and notes as I strengthen my DSA skills.  

---

## 🚀 About  

This repository contains:  
- **Core Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and more.  
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.  
- **Practice Problems**: Solutions to DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.
